### N-Body-Problem-using-CUDA-Accelerate-Computing
- An n-body simulator predicts the individual motions of a group of objects interacting with each other gravitationally. 01-nbody.cu contains a simple, though working, n-body simulator for bodies moving through 3 dimensional space.

- The code is GPU Accelerated format based on CUDA Kernal
